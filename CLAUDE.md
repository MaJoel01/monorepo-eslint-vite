# Opral Monorepo Claude Instructions

- Read the [./contributing.md](./contributing.md) for navigating the monorepo.
- The monorepo uses `pnpm`. Don't use `npm` or `yarn`.
- If you want to test a specific code file, it's easiest to cwd into the package directory and run `pnpm exec vitest run <filter>`.
