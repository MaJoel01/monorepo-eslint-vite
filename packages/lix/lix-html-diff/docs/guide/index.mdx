# Getting Started

## Overview

![HTML Diff Visualization](/diff.svg)

Lix HTML Diff is a simple way to generate and display diffs for any app UI using the "HTML trick" - since most apps ultimately render to HTML, you can use this HTML diff to visualize changes in your application's interface.

- ✅ **Universal**: Works for any app that renders to HTML (which is most apps!)
- ✅ **Simple**: No need for renderer-specific diff logic.
- ✅ **Styling**: Uses your existing CSS.
- ✅ **Framework Agnostic**: Works with React, Vue, Svelte, Angular, and more.

## Installation

```bash
npm install @lix-js/html-diff
```

## Usage

1. Add `data-diff-key` attributes to your rendered HTML elements.
2. Use `renderHtmlDiff` to generate a diff HTML string.
3. Display the diff HTML string in your app.

```typescript
import { renderHtmlDiff } from "@lix-js/html-diff";

// Example before and after HTML
//
// Usually, you would get these from your app's rendering logic,
// but for demonstration, we'll use hardcoded strings.
const beforeHtml = `
  <p data-diff-key='p1'>Old text.</p>
`;
const afterHtml = `
  <p data-diff-key='p1'>Updated text!</p>
  <p data-diff-key='p2'>Added.</p>
`;

const diffHtmlString = renderHtmlDiff({ beforeHtml, afterHtml });

document.getElementById("diff-container")!.innerHTML = diffHtmlString;
```

<Showcase
  before="<p data-diff-key='p1'>Old text.</p>"
  after="<p data-diff-key='p1'>Updated text!</p><p data-diff-key='p2'>Added.</p>"
  css=".diff-before { color: red; } .diff-after { color: green; }"
/>
