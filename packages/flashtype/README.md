## 🧠 What Makes Flashtype Different

### 👁️ WYSIWYG Markdown in Browser

No more annoying preview tabs. Type `# Heading` and see it rendered as a heading instantly. Format text with `**bold**` and see it bold immediately. Pure WYSIWYG markdown editing - what you see is what you get.

### 🌐 Zero Install, Runs Anywhere

Open in any browser - Chrome, Safari, Firefox. No downloads, no installations, no desktop apps. Your documents live in browser storage, work offline, and sync optionally.

Flashtype is also installable as a Progressive Web App (PWA). In any supported browser, open the app, choose **Install** from the address bar menu, and you’ll get a standalone window with offline support and taskbar/dock integration.

### 🤖 Claude Code AI Experience

AI that understands your markdown. Generate content, get suggestions, review diffs, and accept/reject changes just like Claude Code. Copy your markdown and paste it directly into ChatGPT or any other tool.

### 📋 Markdown as Source of Truth

No lossy import/export cycles. Your document IS markdown, not converted to/from markdown. Copy from Flashtype → paste into GitHub → paste back into Flashtype with zero data loss. No vendor lock-in, no proprietary formats.

💡 **Why This Matters:**

- Most editors convert markdown to their own format, creating lossy copy/paste
- Flashtype treats markdown as the native format - no conversion needed
- True lossless workflows between ChatGPT, GitHub, Discord, and more

## 🎯 Perfect For

- **Technical writers** who copy/paste between tools and need AI assistance
- **Content creators** tired of preview tabs and want seamless markdown editing
- **Developers** who want GitHub-compatible markdown without desktop apps
- **Anyone** who works with ChatGPT and wants lossless markdown workflows
