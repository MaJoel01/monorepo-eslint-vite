# Team Meeting — Weekly Sync

- [x] Review last week’s goals
- [ ] Ship the Flashtype editor MVP
- [ ] Prepare docs outline for Lix Inspector

## Decisions

- Adopt sentence case in UI labels
- Keep editor width at a comfortable reading measure

## Notes

> Keep PRs small and focused. Land seeding first,
> then iterate on sidebar + routing.

### Action items

1. Seed sample Markdown files
2. Hook toolbar shortcuts (Bold, Italic, Strike)
3. Add link popover (no prompts)

```bash
pnpm -C packages/flashtype dev
```
